## 1. What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system that uses SQL language.

## 2. What is the purpose of a database schema in PostgreSQL?

The purpose of a database schema in PostgreSQL are many, like it helps to prevent
name conflicts between objects and can also enforce security measures by granting or restricting access to certain users or roles.

## 3. Explain the primary key and foreign key concepts in PostgreSQL.

- **Primary Key**: A primary key is a unique identifier for a row in a table. It can not be null. Each table can have only one primary key, which can be composed of one or more columns.

- **Foreign Key**: A foreign key is a field in a table that refers another's table primary key.

## 4. What is the difference between the VARCHAR and CHAR data types?

- **VARCHAR**: Stands for variable-length character type. It can store strings of any length up to a specified limit.

- **CHAR**: Stands for fixed-length character type. It always occupies the specified length.

## 5. Explain the purpose of the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement.

The `WHERE` clause in a `SELECT` statement is used to filter records that meet specific conditions.

## 6. What are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses used for?

- **LIMIT**: The `LIMIT` clause is used to specify the maximum number of records to return in the result set.

- **OFFSET**: The `OFFSET` clause is used to skip a specified number of records before starting to return the result set. This is useful for pagination.

## 7. How can you perform data modification using UPDATE statements?

We can modify existing data in a PostgreSQL table using the `UPDATE` statement.

## 8. What is the significance of the JOIN operation, and how does it work in PostgreSQL?

The JOIN operation is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. It is significant because it allows you to retrieve related data from multiple tables in a single query.

## 9. Explain the GROUP BY clause and its role in aggregation operations.

The GROUP BY clause is used in conjunction with aggregate functions to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows. It helps in aggregating data for analysis, such as calculating averages, counts, or sums for each group.

## 10. How can you calculate aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG in PostgreSQL?

We can calculate aggregate functions in PostgreSQL using the following syntax:

- **COUNT**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

- **SUM**

```sql
SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

- **AVG**

```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

## 11. What is the purpose of an index in PostgreSQL, and how does it optimize query performance?

An index in PostgreSQL is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional space and overhead on write operations (inserts, updates, deletes).

## 12. Explain the concept of a PostgreSQL view and how it differs from a table.

View just like a function, views is a combination of some query. We can execute the view without knowing its details.
